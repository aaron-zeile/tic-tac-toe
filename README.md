# Tic-Tac-Toe
My first project! This program lets the user play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer!
# Board Layout
The program will ask you to input a number from 1 to 9. These numbers indicate the empty spaces on the game board. The board is labeled similarly to a phone dial pad (top row: 1-3, middle: 4-6, bottom: 7-9).
